## 1. What is a priority queue? Give its applications.

- A priority queue is a queue in which each element is assigned a priority, and elements are removed based on priority rather than arrival time. Higher-priority items are processed first.

- Applications include CPU scheduling in operating systems, printer job scheduling, network routing algorithms, and emergency response systems.

## 2. Explain the concept of a circular queue. How is it better than a linear queue?

- A circular queue is a queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position, forming a circle.

It is better than a linear queue because it efficiently uses memory by reusing freed spaces and avoids the “false overflow” problem.

## 3. Why do we use multiple queues?

- Multiple queues are used to handle different categories of tasks separately.

- They help improve efficiency, allow priority handling, and are useful in systems like multilevel CPU scheduling.

## Fill in the Blanks

- New nodes are added at **rear of the queue**.  
- **Deque (double-ended queue)** allows insertion at either end but not in the middle.  
- The typical time requirement for operations in a linked queue is **O(1)**.  
- In **output-restricted deque**, insertions can be done only at one end while deletions can be done from both ends.  
- **Deque** is implemented using arrays or linked lists.  
- **Queues** are appropriate data structures to process batch computer programs submitted to the computer centre.  
- **Priority queues** are appropriate data structures to process a list of employees having a contract for a seniority system for hiring and firing.
