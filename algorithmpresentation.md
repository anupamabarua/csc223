# Algorithm
## Definition:
A **algorithm** is [a set of finite, well-defined steps or instructions designed to solve case of problems or perform a computation.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-algorithms/)

# Analyize
## Definition:
To **analyize** is to measure and evaluate an alogrithms performance by examining how much time and space it uses as the size of the input increases.

# What do we mean by "analysis of algorithms"?
"Analysis of algorithms" is the study of how efficant a algorithm is. It involves evaluating performance of algorithms and programs, particularly in terms of time and space, as the size of the input grows.

# What about alogirthms needs to be analyzed?
There are 3 things about algorithms that needs to be analyzed.

1.Efficiency
- How fast the algorithm runs

2.Scalability
- How well the algorithm performs when the input size becomes large

3.Space
- How much memory the algorithm requires
